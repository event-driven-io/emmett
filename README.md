# Emmett - Event Sourcing development made simple

**Emmett is an opinionated yet flexible framework that implements Event Sourcing for Node.js applications.** It focuses on composition rather than magic, providing lightweight abstractions and clear patterns that make Event Sourcing accessible and maintainable.

## Why Use Emmett?

Nowadays, storage is cheap, but the information is priceless.

Event Sourcing, keeps all the facts that happened in our system as events. That provides an observability of the business process and enabling event-driven capabilities like building read models, easier integration between components.

**However, implementing Event Sourcing can be challenging due to:**

- additional learning curves for new developers,
- knowing how to structure your code,
- implementing event storage,
- difficulty in setting up proper testing strategies,
- integrating with existing frameworks and infrastructure.

**Emmett solves these problems by:**

- Reducing boilerplate with pragmatic abstractions,
- Providing clear patterns for common operations,
- Supporting multiple testing approaches with built-in utilities,
- Including ready-to-use event store implementations,
- Offering simple integration with Express.js.

**Check Emmett and take your event-driven applications back to the future!**

## FAQ

### **Is it production-ready?**

What's there is safe to use. I'd like to add more stuff to enhance the production experience, like OpenTelemetry, but users are already using Emmett in their systems.

### **Why Node.js?**

I like its minimalistic approach and flexibility, plus TypeScript is an excellent language with its shapeshifter capabilities. Plus, I've been asked if I could deliver such a store for Node.js.

### Why is it named Emmett?

[Because](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Brown).

### **What features will it have?**

We'll see, but for sure, I'd like to have the following:

- implementation of event store using other storage engines like DynamoDB, CosmosDB etc.
- building blocks for integration and running distributed processes,
- GraphQL API for event stores,
- Full stack development helpers with Next.js or HTMX,
- built-in open telemetry,
- streaming data through HTTP API (and enabling integration scenarios through it).
- defining event transformations and projections with WebAssembly,
- etc.

### **Would it be a competitor to other stores?**

It is hard to say; my intention is not to compete but to give more options to the community.

### **Why there's no license?**

Because I'm unsure how this will end, and I don't want to expose it as an MIT license from the beginning.
